    <h2>Taxes and Duties</h2>
    <p>All items are shipped on a DDP (Delivery Duty Paid) basis. This means that we add the costs of import duties and taxes to your order, so no charges are payable when the item is delivered to you. These charges will apply to items shipped outside of the EU above a certain value and will be clearly listed on the shopping cart page prior to payment being processed.</p>
    <p>VAT is added to orders where applicable. If applied to your order, this charge will be clearly listed on the shopping cart page prior to payment being processed.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Insurance</h2>
    <p>Items are fully insured until they are delivered and the item has been signed for. At this point, responsibility for your purchased items passes to you (or whoever signs for the item. This includes gift receipients or other people present at the delivery address).</p>
    <p>Missed Deliveries</p>
    <p>If you miss a delivery, a calling card will be left by the courier with details of how to collect the items or arrange a redelivery. Please follow the instructions on the calling card, as any unclaimed items may be returned to us. If you have not received your items or a calling card within the specified time frame, please contact our Customer Services Department.</p>
    <p>Failure to follow instructions on the calling card left by the courier may result in the items being returned to us. In such instances, we will process refunds when we have received the returned items. Delivery charges will not be refunded and further delivery charges may be made to you if redelivery is requested.</p>

                <h2>Booking some of the cheapest shipping&nbsp;to Nigeria with ups and fedex</h2>

    <p>Nigeria is one of the larger African nations, with more citizens than any other country in Africa. In fact, in total population, Nigeria's 158.2 million citizens rank number seven worldwide, meaning the amount of parcels being sent to Nigeria is considerable. When it comes to the government, since Nigeria's 1960 move to independence the country has closely followed the republic model popularised by the United States. The population of Nigeria is about equally divided between Muslim and Christian religious beliefs. Due to often difficult living conditions, Nigerians regularly immigrate to the United States, as well as European countries like the United Kingdom, so it could well be the case that parcels being sent from around the world are being sent back home by Nigerian expats. Nigeria is a middle-class country and is characterised as an emerging or developing nation. The country is rich in natural resources, has its own stock exchange, as well as a reliable communications infrastructure. The US is the largest investor in Nigeria, although British companies also invest measurably in Nigeria's economy. A full 40% of Nigeria's GDP is centred around oil production. Other strong industries include telecommunications, financial sectors, natural gas, gold, lead, iron, cocoa, yams, citrus fruit and sugar. Strong manufacturing items include fabric, leather, plastics and automobiles. In a recent PayPal survey 31% of Nigerians who do not shop online cited concerns over the security of payments as a reason for not doing so, so eCommerce retailers need to resolve this issue, and install trust in the buyers by providing tracked and speedy delivery of goods. When looking for parcel delivery to all cities including Lagos, Kano, Abuja, Ibadan, Kaduna and Port Harcourt, be sure to compare the best courier services on our global shipping marketplace.</p>
